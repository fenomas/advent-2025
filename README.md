# Advent-2025

This is my live-coding environment and hacked-up solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/).

> [Run live in browser](https://fenomas.github.io/advent-2025/)

Puzzle solutions are in: [/src/advent/](https://github.com/fenomas/advent-2025/tree/main/src/advent/). The rigging and HMR and so forth use `solid.js` this year.

## To run locally:

1.  clone repo
2.  `pnpm i` (or npm, yarn, etc)
3.  `pnpm dev`
4.  Put puzzle inputs into each day's `src/advent/day??/input.md` files, then hack on each day's `solution.ts` and view live results at `localhost:8080`.
